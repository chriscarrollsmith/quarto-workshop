# Skip the setup

![GitHub](workshop-qr.png)

To **skip all the installation steps for this workshop**, use a GitHub Codespace:

- **1. Go to the repo**: <https://github.com/chriscarrollsmith/quarto-workshop>.
- **2. Click the green “Code” button.**
- **3. Select the “Codespaces” tab, then “Create codespace on main”.**

GitHub will start a cloud dev environment with **Quarto, Python, R, and LaTeX pre-configured**. It might take a few minutes to start, because it's downloading and building all the dependencies from scratch.

# Quarto YAML headers

Most Quarto documents start with a **YAML header** that controls metadata and output.

-   Available options documented here: <https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/opml.html>
-   The Quarto Extension for VSCode will give you tool tips and autocomplete for the YAML header.

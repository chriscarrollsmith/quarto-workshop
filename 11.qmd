# Editor modes

There are two editor modes for working with `.qmd` (Quarto Markdown) files in VSCode:

- **Source mode**: This is the default mode. It lets you edit the document as a plain text file with mostly standard markdown syntax.
- **Visual editor mode**: This mode lets you edit the document using a visual editor that provides a "what you see is what you get" interface for the document.

To switch modes, right-click in the document or search "Quarto: Edit" in the command palette ("View > Command Palette" or `ctrl + shift + P`).

If editing with AI, you should use *source mode*.

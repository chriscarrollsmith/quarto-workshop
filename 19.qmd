# Converting to a Book

To render all files as a book, create a `_quarto.yml` file:

```yaml
project:
  type: book

book:
  title: "Quarto Workshop"
  author: "Chris"
  chapters:
    - 01.qmd
    - 02.qmd
    - 03.qmd
    # ... list all files in desired order

bibliography: references.bib

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
```

For full details on formatting a book, see <https://quarto.org/docs/books/>.

Then render the book:

```bash
quarto render
```

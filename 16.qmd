# Execution Options

Control code execution and display with cell options (lines starting with `#|`).

The main use case for code that's evaluated but not echoed is to perform setup steps, as state is persisted across code blocks.

```{python}
#| echo: false

# Define dictionary in hidden block
options = {
    "eval": "Evaluate the code chunk (true/false).",
    "echo": "Include source code in output (true/false/fenced).",
    "output": "Include results in output (true/false/asis).",
    "warning": "Include warnings in output (true/false)."
}
```

```{python}
#| echo: true

# Access variable from previous block
from IPython.display import Markdown

rows = [f"| `{k}` | {v} |" for k, v in options.items()]
table = "| Option | Description |\n|---|---|\n" + "\n".join(rows)

Markdown(table)
```
